# ICC-BiFormer
There are three folders. 

Models are the code of ICC-BiFormer and other models to compare with.

example_data_inspect is the image data we use after adjusting brightness. It’s provied for individuals seeking insights into image characteristics without additional programs to visualize the images. The images here are in 8-bit PNG format.

real_streaks are the real streaks cropping from ZTF data and after processing. It’s provied for individuals to check the differences between real and simulated streaks.

example_data_train represents a small subset of our training data. The original data’s ZIP archive is 20GB, which expands to 60GB after unzipping. We have only uploaded a small portion for the purpose of model deployment and format inspection. The link for total data is：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mN4JSYMhDgN-WgAlUs19OA?pwd=ICCB and the password is ICCB /
